# 08 - Design Spec Alignment Matrix

Last updated: 2026-02-12
Status: Finalized mapping

## Objective
Make the relationship explicit between `docs/design.md` and each redesign plan file.

## Mapping

| Plan File | Primary Design Sections |
|---|---|
| `00-goals-and-constraints.md` | Sections 1, 2, 10, 11, 12 |
| `01-visual-aesthetic-and-typography.md` | Sections 1, 2, 3.2 |
| `02-design-system-and-tokens.md` | Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4, 8 |
| `03-studio-stepper-shell.md` | Section 7 |
| `04-product-shoots-step-flow.md` | Sections 7, 8 |
| `05-ad-graphics-step-flow.md` | Sections 7, 8 |
| `06-landing-page-strategy.md` | Sections 5, 6 |
| `07-implementation-roadmap.md` | Sections 1 through 13 |

## Enforcement Rule
1. During implementation and reviews, cite both the plan file and the linked `docs/design.md` section.
2. If a plan statement conflicts with `docs/design.md`, update the plan and keep the design spec as source of truth.
