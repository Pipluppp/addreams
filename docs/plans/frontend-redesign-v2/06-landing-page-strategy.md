# 06 - Landing Page Strategy

Last updated: 2026-02-12
Status: Finalized (aligned to docs/design.md)

## Objective
Design a modern landing page that drives users into studio workflows with clear conversion intent.

## Design Linkage
1. Aligns with `docs/design.md` sections 5 and 6.
2. Typography and accent usage must follow `docs/design.md` sections 3.1 and 3.2.

## Narrative Structure
1. Hero section:
   - strong value proposition
   - two direct CTAs (`Product Shoots`, `Ad Graphics`)
2. Proof strip:
   - social proof metrics and trust signals
3. Workflow overview:
   - two cards with concise step preview
4. Output showcase:
   - curated visuals from MVP assets
5. Why Addreams:
   - compact benefit blocks
6. Final CTA:
   - direct path into studio

## Visual Direction
1. Modern, clean layout with large typography moments.
2. Bold but controlled tri-accent usage (`#0064FF`, `#EC520B`, `#FFCB00`) with strict role mapping.
3. Subtle motion and clear content hierarchy.
4. Mobile-first composition with no dense sections.
5. Section hierarchy should remain clear in grayscale.

## Performance Rules
1. Lazy-load heavy image sections.
2. Keep hero interaction light and CSS-driven.
3. Maintain route-level split and avoid large synchronous bundles.
