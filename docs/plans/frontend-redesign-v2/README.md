# Frontend Redesign V2 Plan Pack

Last updated: 2026-02-12
Status: Finalized planning baseline

## Objective
Fully redesign the frontend experience for Addreams to deliver:
1. A cleaner, more premium and consistent visual aesthetic.
2. Step-based studio workflows for `Product Shoots` and `Ad Graphics`.
3. A modern, marketable landing page with clear conversion paths.
4. Strong typography direction using `Google Sans Flex` + selective `Geist Pixel Circle` accents.
5. A controlled tri-accent color system using `#0064FF`, `#EC520B`, and `#FFCB00`.
6. Consistent rounded geometry using `squircle-js` for all rounded UI components.

## Design Source of Truth
1. `docs/design.md` is the final visual and UX specification for this redesign.
2. All plan files in this pack map directly to sections in `docs/design.md`.

## Scope
1. Frontend UX/UI architecture and design system refresh.
2. Route and interaction redesign for landing and studio workflows.
3. Existing backend contracts remain stub-based in this phase.

## Plan Files
1. `00-goals-and-constraints.md`
2. `01-visual-aesthetic-and-typography.md`
3. `02-design-system-and-tokens.md`
4. `03-studio-stepper-shell.md`

7. `06-landing-page-strategy.md`

9. `08-design-spec-alignment.md`

## Execution Order
1. Lock aesthetic + typography decisions.
2. Implement shared design system and studio stepper shell.
3. Build Product Shoots step flow.
4. Build Ad Graphics step flow.
5. Build marketable landing page.
6. QA and release checks.
